	<p><i>4 out of 5 stars</i></p>
     <p>From director <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning the true value of friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.</p>
       <p>This movie has everything you could ask for:</p>
         <u1>
            <li>A basketball</li>
            <li>A dog</li>
            <li>Nail-biting suspence</li>
          </u1>
          <p>While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.</p>

<p><i>3 out of 5 stars</i></p>
<p>From acclaimed director <b>Nick runderdun</b> comes a thrillingtale of suspence and intrigue set on the winding roads of the hollywood hills. derk (roban grunsule) is a former mechanic turned thief doing everything  he can to pay his grandmother's hospital bills, while funnyman dobert brokus takes a dramatic turn as officer pete, a cop on the edge who is also a loose cannon only two days from retirement.</p>
<p>This movie will keep you on the edge of the seat with:</p>
<u1>
  <li>Motorcycle chases</li>
  <li>striking visuals</li>
  <li>Minutes long series of derk staring thoughtfully out of windows</li>
</u1>
<p>The tension that the film works so hard to create is undercut, though, by runderdun's decision to include a laugh track. even the final showdown between derk and officer pete, during which derek tearfully explains his grandmother's struggle, is punctuated by uproarious laughter as if from a live audience. If you love motorcycles or thrilling car and mouse games, though, you will hopefully be able to look past it. </p>
